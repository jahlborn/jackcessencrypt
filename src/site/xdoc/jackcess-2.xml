        <p>
          The Jackcess project has changed its public API to version 2.x as part
          of a long-overdue overhaul.  These changes are superficial, but are not
          backwards compatible with Jackcess 1.x (<a href="https://jackcess.sourceforge.io/jackcess-2.html">full details
          here</a>).  Jackcess Encrypt has similarly changed its version number in
          order to make it easy to match compatible versions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Jackcess 2.x -&gt; Jackcess Encrypt 2.y</li>
          <li>Jackcess 1.x -&gt; Jackcess Encrypt 1.y</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="What does this mean for 1.x?">
        <p>
          Moving forward, all new feature development will be in Jackcess
          Encrypt 2.x.  The Jackcess Encrypt 1.x code has been branched at
          version 1.0.4 and some bugfixes may be backported to that branch on a
          case by case basis.  However, no new feature development will be done
          on the 1.x branch.
